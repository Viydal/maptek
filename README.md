# Block Model Compression Algorithm
## Software Engineering Project â€“ Semester 2, 2025

This repository contains our implementation for the Block Model Compression Algorithm, a gamified software engineering challenge involving lossless compression of large 3D block models with the goal of optimising compression ratio and execution speed.

The algorithm reads a block model from standard input in a specified format, compresses it by grouping uniform-colour regions into larger rectangular blocks (up to a given parent block size), and writes the compressed result to standard output.
